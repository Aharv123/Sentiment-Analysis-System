Furthermore, many tweets are replies to other tweets and detecting sarcasm in these requires the availability of contextual tweets.\n\nTo overcome the limitations related to noise in Twitter datasets, this **News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection** is collected from two news website. [*TheOnion*](https://www.theonion.com/) aims at producing sarcastic versions of current events and we collected all the headlines from News in Brief and News in Photos categories (which are sarcastic). We collect real (and non-sarcastic) news headlines from [*HuffPost*](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/).\n\nThis new dataset has following advantages over the existing Twitter datasets:\n\n* Since news headlines are written by professionals in a formal manner, there are no spelling mistakes and informal usage. This reduces the sparsity and also increases the chance of finding pre-trained embeddings.\n\n* Furthermore, since the sole purpose of *TheOnion* is to publish sarcastic news, we get high-quality labels with much less noise as compared to Twitter datasets.\n\n* Unlike tweets which are replies to other tweets, the news headlines we obtained are self-contained. This would help us in teasing apart the real sarcastic elements.\n\n### Content\nEach record consists of three attributes:\n\n* \u0060\u0060\u0060is_sarcastic\u0060\u0060\u0060: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0\n\n* \u0060\u0060\u0060headline\u0060\u0060\u0060: the headline of the news article\n\n* \u0060\u0060\u0060article_link\u0060\u0060\u0060: link to the original news article.
